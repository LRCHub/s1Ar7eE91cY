```lrc
[01:39.99] You know how to get eternal life
[01:43.26] In the center of the lightning-speed waltz
[01:47.12] Feel your soul cut by a rusty knife
[01:50.23] As you head down for the self-destructive edge
[02:13.23] 
[01:55.05] Our satori is just floating in the core
[01:58.10] Where we can spiritually go through the door
[02:01.61] We'll know how to get eternal life
[02:04.94] While we catch the pulse from unknown satellites
[02:28.94] 
[02:08.50] If we get the transient facts
[02:12.04] Then we'll feel the info high
[02:15.63] If we get the transient facts
[02:19.27] Then we are really free
[02:23.61] To fly high
[02:27.73] In space
[02:31.73] 
[02:42.32] We know how to get eternal high
[02:45.43] In the center of the lightning-speed waltz
[02:49.41] See our soul struggling to survive
[02:52.44] As we head down for the self-destructive edge
[03:14.94] 
[02:57.09] Sayonara to intrusive noise
[03:00.60] No more childish play and no more toys
[03:03.78] We know how to get eternal life
[03:06.89] While we feel and sense mother nature's strong might
[03:32.89] 
[03:10.95] If we get the transient facts
[03:14.54] Then we'll feel the info high
[03:17.99] If we get the transient facts

[03:25.11] If we get the transient facts
[03:28.59] Then we'll feel the info high
[03:32.15] If we get the transient facts
[03:35.72] Then we are really free
[03:40.22] To fly high
[03:44.34] In space
[03:48.34] 
[05:17.29] If we get the transient facts
[05:20.84] Then we'll feel the info high
